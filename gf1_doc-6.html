<P>Playing a timed game is like playing with a chess-clock.
<P>When it's your turn, your clock will run down. When it's your opponents move,
your clock will stop and his will start.
<P>When one of the players runs out of time, he loses instantly.
<P>The computer-player is smart enough not to run out of time. When his current
strenght level would cause him to run out of time, he will automatically 
switch to a lower setting.
<P>
