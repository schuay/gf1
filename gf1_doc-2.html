<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Manual for the impatient</A></H2>

<P>This part of the manual will teach you enough about the program
to start playing against the computer as quick as possible.
<P>If you want to know everything about all the different menu-options, then
you will have to read the next chapters.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Game Setup</A>
</H2>

<P>You can change the strength of the computer-player with the "Setup"-option
in the File-menu.
<P>Choose one of the levels for computer strength and press the OK-button.
Level 1 is a very bad player, only appropriate for beginners. Level 8 is
a very, very good player, but one move from the computer make take an hour
or longer. Level 4 and 5 are strong players which don't take too long thinking
about their moves.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Start a new game</A>
</H2>

<P>You start a game with the New-option from the File-menu.
<P>The window shown contains several areas: For general things about the new
game and things that must be setup for each player separatly.
<P>The first thing you should choose is what kind of game to play. The 3
different games described in the GIPF-rules are available: basic, standard
and tournament.
<P>The "Timed game"-option allows you to make the game more difficult by
restricting the time you have for playing a complete game. If you check
this option, you can also change the time each player has for the game.
(You can give the players a different time.)
<P>Now you have to choose who will play white and black. For each color you
can choose if it will be controlled by a human- or a computer-player, 
you can enter the player-name, and if you chose the "Timed game"-option, 
then you can also change the time allowed for a game.
<P>When you are happy with your selections, press OK and the game will start.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Play the game</A>
</H2>

<P>single pieces on the board are white (really light yellow)
and black. Gipf pieces of both colours have an extra gray circle on them.
<P>How to make a move:
<UL>
<LI> Click on one of the black circles around the gameboard to set the
point from where you want to add a piece.
The new piece will be shown on that position</LI>
<LI> Click on the point where you want to move your new piece.
A red cross will appear there.</LI>
<LI> Now click on the 'Execute move'-button under the gameboard and your
move will be executed.</LI>
<LI> At the beginning of a tournament game you can add gipf-pieces,
when you want to stop adding gipf-pieces just click again on the
piece you are adding. this will replace the gipf-piece with a normal
piece. (Clicking again will change the piece to a gipf again.)</LI>
</UL>
    
<P>In some circumstances the program will ask you if you want to remove a row
of pieces or gipf-pieces. The relevant pieces are shown on the board with
a red cross on them.
<P>The program automatically detects if the game is finished and will tell
you who won and how many moves it took.
