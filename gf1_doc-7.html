<H2><A NAME="s7">7. Edit a gameboard</A></H2>

<P>When you use the "Edit board"-option from the Edit menu, the user-interface
changes to allow you to edit the gameboard in any way you like.
<P>In this mode you can add or remove pieces or gipf-pieces of any colour and 
change the "lost pieces"-counters to create any gipf-situation you want.
<P>When you changed the board to your liking, you can start playing from
that situation.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 Select what type of piece to add</A>
</H2>

<P>There are 2 ways to select the type of piece you want to add to the board:
<UL>
<LI>At the bottom of the window is a button that shows the currently selected
piece to be added. Clicking this button allows you to change it to any of
the possibilities.</LI>
<LI>When you right-click with your mouse over the game-board you can also
select the type of piece to add. This will immediatly be shown on the button
at the bottom also.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 Add or remove a piece from the board</A>
</H2>

<P>To add a piece, just move the mouse over the position where you want to put the
new piece and click. This will put the currently selected type of piece at
that position and adapt the counter of available pieces for the corresponding
colour.
<P>Removing a piece is just as easy. Move the mouse over the piece you want
to remove and click. The piece will be removed and the corresponding counter
adapted.
<P>If you want to replace a piece with a different one then you have to click
twice, once to remove the old piece and again to place the new piece.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3 Changing the "lost pieces"-counters</A>
</H2>

<P>For changing the number of pieces lost by each player there are 2 counters
at the bottom of the window.
<P>Pressing the left-button of a counter will decrease the number (not below 0), 
pressing the right-button will increase it.
<P>Automatically, the number of available pieces will be updated correctly.
