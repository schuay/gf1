<P>The main GF1-window consists of several sections.
<P>At the top you have the menu-bar and at the bottom you have buttons which 
differ depending on what you are doing.
In the middle you can see from left to right:
<UL>
<LI>Information about the white player (Player name, timer, number of
pieces left, number of pieces lost)</LI>
<LI>The gipf-board</LI>
<LI>Information about the black player</LI>
<LI>A log of all the moves</LI>
</UL>
<P>The player-name with a red background shows whose turn it is.
<P>If you set the "show position names"-option in the setup-window, then you will
see the position-name of the position you are over appear if you stay over the
same place on the gameboard for 1/2 a second.
<P>The pieces for playing GIPF are shown on the board as white 
(really light yellow) and black discs. Gipf pieces (2 normal pieces on
top of each other) have an extra gray circle on them.
<P>
