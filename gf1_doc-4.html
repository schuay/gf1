<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Moving pieces on the board</A></H2>

<P>Making a move consists of several steps:
<UL>
<LI> Click on one of the black circles around the gameboard to set the
point from where you want to add a piece.
The new piece will be shown on that position</LI>
<LI> Click on the point where you want to move your new piece.
A red cross will appear there.</LI>
<LI> Now click on the 'Execute move'-button under the gameboard and your
move will be executed. Pressing &lt;enter&gt; also executes your move.
Clicking a second time on the position with the red cross will also
execute the move.</LI>
</UL>
    
<P>At the beginning of a tournament game you can add gipf-pieces to the game.
When you want to stop adding gipf-pieces, just click again on the
piece you are adding, the gipf-piece will be replaced with a normal piece.
<P>When the computer-player is thinking on what move to make, a window is
shown with a "thinker" and a button which allows you to interrupt the computer.
