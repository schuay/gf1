<title>GF1 (Gipf for one)
<author>Kurt Van den Branden (<htmlurl url="mailto:kurtvdb@@village.uunet.be" name="kurtvdb@@village.uunet.be">)

<abstract>
GF1 is a computer program for playing the 2 player boardgame GIPF.
The program has a nice and easy to use graphical user interface.
You can play against another human (but the real game is better for that), 
against the computer, or let the computer play against itself.
The computer player is good enough to beat even the best human players at the
moment (but it doesn't always win :-) ).
</abstract>


<!-- ##################################################################### -->
<sect>What is this game called GIPF?
<p>
GIPF is a strategic game for two players based on a classic
concept: in turns, players introduce one piece into play until
achieving four-in-a-row. Players then remove their row and capture
any of their opponent's pieces which extend that row. This
principle of capturing pieces creates each time again completely
changed situations on the board. The purpose is to form successive
rows of at least 4 pieces, until the opponent has no piece left to
bring into play.

(This description was copied from the official GIPF web-site. For
more info about the GIPF-game, check 
<htmlurl url="http://www.gipf.com" name="http://www.gipf.com">)

<descrip>
<tag/REMARK:/This manual does not contain the rules for GIPF. If you
don't know the game yet, go and buy it or check the GIPF homepage.
</descrip>

<!-- ##################################################################### -->
<sect>Manual for the impatient
<p>
This part of the manual will teach you enough about the program
to start playing against the computer as quick as possible.

If you want to know everything about all the different menu-options, then
you will have to read the next chapters.

<sect1>Game Setup
<p>
You can change the strength of the computer-player with the "Setup"-option
in the File-menu.

Choose one of the levels for computer strength and press the OK-button.
Level 1 is a very bad player, only appropriate for beginners. Level 8 is
a very, very good player, but one move from the computer make take an hour
or longer. Level 4 and 5 are strong players which don't take too long thinking
about their moves.

<sect1>Start a new game
<p>
You start a game with the New-option from the File-menu.

The window shown contains several areas: For general things about the new
game and things that must be setup for each player separatly.

The first thing you should choose is what kind of game to play. The 3
different games described in the GIPF-rules are available: basic, standard
and tournament.

The "Timed game"-option allows you to make the game more difficult by
restricting the time you have for playing a complete game. If you check
this option, you can also change the time each player has for the game.
(You can give the players a different time.)

Now you have to choose who will play white and black. For each color you
can choose if it will be controlled by a human- or a computer-player, 
you can enter the player-name, and if you chose the "Timed game"-option, 
then you can also change the time allowed for a game.

When you are happy with your selections, press OK and the game will start.

<sect1>Play the game
<p>
single pieces on the board are white (really light yellow)
and black. Gipf pieces of both colours have an extra gray circle on them.

How to make a move:
<itemize>
<item> Click on one of the black circles around the gameboard to set the
       point from where you want to add a piece.
       The new piece will be shown on that position
<item> Click on the point where you want to move your new piece.
       A red cross will appear there.
<item> Now click on the 'Execute move'-button under the gameboard and your
       move will be executed.
<item> At the beginning of a tournament game you can add gipf-pieces,
       when you want to stop adding gipf-pieces just click again on the
       piece you are adding. this will replace the gipf-piece with a normal
       piece. (Clicking again will change the piece to a gipf again.)
</itemize>    

In some circumstances the program will ask you if you want to remove a row
of pieces or gipf-pieces. The relevant pieces are shown on the board with
a red cross on them.

The program automatically detects if the game is finished and will tell
you who won and how many moves it took.

<!-- ##################################################################### -->
<sect>Screen layout
<p>
The main GF1-window consists of several sections.

At the top you have the menu-bar and at the bottom you have buttons which 
differ depending on what you are doing.
In the middle you can see from left to right:
<itemize>
<item>Information about the white player (Player name, timer, number of
pieces left, number of pieces lost)
<item>The gipf-board
<item>Information about the black player
<item>A log of all the moves
</itemize>

The player-name with a red background shows whose turn it is.

If you set the "show position names"-option in the setup-window, then you will
see the position-name of the position you are over appear if you stay over the
same place on the gameboard for 1/2 a second.

The pieces for playing GIPF are shown on the board as white 
(really light yellow) and black discs. Gipf pieces (2 normal pieces on
top of each other) have an extra gray circle on them.

<!-- ##################################################################### -->
<sect>Moving pieces on the board
<p>
Making a move consists of several steps:
<itemize>
<item> Click on one of the black circles around the gameboard to set the
       point from where you want to add a piece.
       The new piece will be shown on that position
<item> Click on the point where you want to move your new piece.
       A red cross will appear there.
<item> Now click on the 'Execute move'-button under the gameboard and your
       move will be executed. Pressing &lt;enter&gt; also executes your move.
       Clicking a second time on the position with the red cross will also
       execute the move.
</itemize>    

At the beginning of a tournament game you can add gipf-pieces to the game.
When you want to stop adding gipf-pieces, just click again on the
piece you are adding, the gipf-piece will be replaced with a normal piece.

When the computer-player is thinking on what move to make, a window is
shown with a "thinker" and a button which allows you to interrupt the computer.

<!-- ##################################################################### -->
<sect>Removing a row of pieces or a gipf-piece
<p>
Every time a row of four pieces of the same colours occurs on the board, this
row is automatically removed from the board by the program.

When more then 1 row of the same colour is on the board at the same time, 
the program will ask the corresponding player what row to remove first. 
The row you can remove at that moment will be made clear with red crosses 
on top of the pieces.

Something similar occurs when you have the chance to remove a gipf-piece from 
the board. The piece that can be removed will get a red cross and the
program will ask you if you want to remove it or not.

<descrip>
<tag/REMARK:/Even when you can remove a gipf-piece from your opponent from the
board will the program ask you if you want to do this. In some situations it
can be benificial to leave your opponents gipf on the board.
</descrip>

<!-- ##################################################################### -->
<sect>Playing with a timer
<p>
Playing a timed game is like playing with a chess-clock.

When it's your turn, your clock will run down. When it's your opponents move,
your clock will stop and his will start.

When one of the players runs out of time, he loses instantly.

The computer-player is smart enough not to run out of time. When his current
strenght level would cause him to run out of time, he will automatically 
switch to a lower setting.

<!-- ##################################################################### -->
<sect>Edit a gameboard
<p>
When you use the "Edit board"-option from the Edit menu, the user-interface
changes to allow you to edit the gameboard in any way you like.

In this mode you can add or remove pieces or gipf-pieces of any colour and 
change the "lost pieces"-counters to create any gipf-situation you want.

When you changed the board to your liking, you can start playing from
that situation.

<sect1>Select what type of piece to add
<p>
There are 2 ways to select the type of piece you want to add to the board:
<itemize>
<item>At the bottom of the window is a button that shows the currently selected
piece to be added. Clicking this button allows you to change it to any of
the possibilities.
<item>When you right-click with your mouse over the game-board you can also
select the type of piece to add. This will immediatly be shown on the button
at the bottom also.
</itemize>

<sect1>Add or remove a piece from the board
<p>
To add a piece, just move the mouse over the position where you want to put the
new piece and click. This will put the currently selected type of piece at
that position and adapt the counter of available pieces for the corresponding
colour.

Removing a piece is just as easy. Move the mouse over the piece you want
to remove and click. The piece will be removed and the corresponding counter
adapted.

If you want to replace a piece with a different one then you have to click
twice, once to remove the old piece and again to place the new piece.

<sect1>Changing the "lost pieces"-counters
<p>
For changing the number of pieces lost by each player there are 2 counters
at the bottom of the window.

Pressing the left-button of a counter will decrease the number (not below 0), 
pressing the right-button will increase it.

Automatically, the number of available pieces will be updated correctly.

<!-- ##################################################################### -->
<sect>The menubar
<p>
<sect1>File menu
<p>
The File menu contains general options for dealing with a game of GIPF.

<descrip>
<tag/New game/This is the option to use when you want to start a new game. It 
opens a window allowing you to enter all the settings necessary for a 
game of GIPF:
<itemize>
<item>Game type: Here you choose the type of game you want to play. These
options correspond to the 3 game-types explained in the official GIPF-rules.
<item>Timed game: Turn this option on if you want to restrict the time each
player has for playing a complete game.
<item>Player (white and black): For each colour you can choose what kind
of player will use it. Choose human for one colour and computer for the other
if you want to play against the computer, but both sides human or both
sides computer are also valid settings.
<item>Player name (white and black): The names entered here will be shown on
each side of the game-board.
<item>Player time (white and black): If you turned on the "Timed game"-option
then you can change the number of minutes allowed for each player.
</itemize>

<tag/Load game/Load a game that you saved earlier. If you saved during a game
then you can resume the game from where you stopped.

<tag/Save game/Save a game in progress. This allows you to return to the game
later. A window will open where you can enter a filename.

<tag/Save log/If you just finished a memorable game then you can use this
option to save all your moves to a file. In case you want to see later how
you won (or lost) that game.

<tag/Setup/Change game settings:
<itemize>
<item>Computer strength: From 1 to 8, level one is for absolute beginners, from
level 4 on the computer plays quite strong. At settings above 5 the computer 
can take a long time calculating his move. 
<item>Move animation: If you turn the animation on, every move you make will be
shown with moving pieces (This makes it easier to understand what is 
happening). 
<item>Wait before computer move: To make computer moves easier to understand 
you can make the program wait before executing each computer move. The program
will show what move the computer intends to make and wait the number of
seconds you enter here.
<item>Wait before removing a row/gipf: To make it easier to understand what
happens when rows and gipf-pieces are removed from the board, you can set this
to something different then 0. The computer will then show what it intends to 
remove and wait a number of seconds.
<item>Show position names: If you set this option then position-names
will be shown on the board when you move over it.
</itemize>

<tag/Exit/Stop the program. Make sure you saved the current game if necessary.
</descrip>

<sect1>Edit menu
<p>
Only the first option from the Edit menu (Edit board) can be used when you are
not in the edit mode of the program. 'Save board' and 'Make drawing' can also
be used when you are playing a game. But the others are only available when
you are editing the game-board.

<descrip>
<tag/Edit board/Start editing the game-board. (See above for how this works)
<tag/Start game/Start a game from the board-situation you were editing. A
window opens allowing you to start a game.
<tag/Computer move/Have the computer calculate one move from the current
board-position. You can choose if it is white or black who has to play and
the strength of the computer (higher is better).
<tag/Clear board/Empty the board, put it in the same situation like the start
of a tournament-game.
<tag/Restore board/Restore the board to the situation before your started
editing the board. Also exit edit-mode and return to play-mode.
<tag/Load board/Load a board-position from a file.
<tag/Save board/Save the current board-position to a file.
<tag/Make drawing/Make a png-file of the current board-situation. You can
specify a file-name, the size of the resulting picture and an accompanying
text.
</descrip>

<sect1>UNDO
<p>
When you use UNDO, the game will be returned to the situation before
you made your last move. This allows you to try again if you made a stupid
mistake.

This option from the menubar is only usable under certain conditions:
<itemize>
<item>During a game
<item>When you are not playing a timed game. (this would be too much like
cheating)
</itemize>

<bf>REMARK:</bf> You can only do UNDO once at a certain moment in
the game. It is not possible to press UNDO several times to go back more
than 1 move.

<sect1>Help menu
<p>
This menu contains only 2 options.

The HELP-option opens a window containing the complete GF1-manual.
At the top you get a list of all the different chapters in the manual. When
you click on one of the lines, the helptext will immediatly jump to the
correct chapter. The help-window can be left open while playing.

The ABOUT-option just opens a window showing the version of GF1 you are
using and the author. Press enter or click on the window to remove it.
(This is the same window you see when GF1 starts up. At startup, the window 
goes away automatically after 5 seconds.)
