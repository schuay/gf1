@what's needed for a gf1-server
@
text
@- ask for confirmation of exit or when pressing ESC
  subclassing of Fl_Window necessary (I think)

- ask for confirmation when starting a new game if a game
  is already in progress.

- add setup for the computer player -> advanced settings
     + separate settings for white and black computer-player
     + nr of gipf-pieces for tournament-game
     + memory-depth (only for ai_mtdf)
     + random choose

- update the computer player to use a transposition table
  (should improve the speed, but I'm not sure)

- make a network playable version: this means changes to GF1 and
  a new program to work as server.

  features of the server:
     + play a game
     + messages between players
     + save games played via the server
     + always play against first available player, or possibility
       to choose opponent?
       when connection is made, list connected players (without a game)
       3 possibilities:
          - choose player
          - choose random player
          - wait (added to list of connected player)
            => maybe this doesn't have to be an explicit option.
               just update the list every minute or so and always add
               the player to the connected list immediatly

- show the gipf-board using openGL to add a nice 3D-look

- replace ai_minimax with ai_mtdf when all the bugs are removed from
  ai_mtdf

- add iterative deepening to the computer-player, so it is possible to
  have the computer stop before running out of time

- make the computer stop thinking IMMEDIATLY when the user wants to stop

- the computer-player (ai_minimax or ai_mtdf) only has to generate an
  accurate move if we are searching at depth 1.

- problem of the process not going away when you stop the program on Windows
  with the left/top button instead of the normal exit-option.
