 v 1.03
--------
- a new way to execute a move has been added: if you now click on the
  to-position when it has already been selected, your move gets executed.
- added license-section to the about-box.
- the main window titlebar will show the name of the file you loaded or
  saved. when saving you can automatically use the same name as the 
  previously loaded file.
- started using a new filechooser widget. (should be easier for windows-users)
- the file produced by the option "save log" now has the format specified
  on the gipf website for writing down games.

 v 1.02
--------
- new saved game fileformat, everything about a game is saved now.
- possibility to save a game at any time, even at the moment when a player
  is asked what row he wants to remove or if he wants to remove a gipf
  (these changes should make it possible to use gf1 for playing by e-mail)
- the about-window now shows that the program is postcardware, so maybe
  I will receive some postcards now.
- switch to gd-1.7.3 for producing a picture of the board-situation.
  because of license-problems this library doesn't produce gif-files anymore
  but png-files instead.

 v 1.01
--------
- small performance problem: when a soft timeout occured, the best move
  from the previous iteration was used, and not from the last one.
- big performance improvement: better way of avoiding duplicate moves
  (now a lot closer in speed to version 0.99.5)
- instead of wasting time, the very first move of a game is now chosen at
  random by the computer.
- when creating a gif-file, you can now include a gipf-logo.
- I've started using STL for some lists, so when you want to compile the
  program yourself you need a compiler with a good STL implementation

 v 1.0 (not beta anymore)
-------
- solved timing-problems on MS Windows (FLTK-problem)
- new computer-player (slower than the previous one)
- computer-player can now be interrupted immediatly
- the computer-player takes time into account when playing a timed game

 v 0.99.5 beta
----------
- fixed bug: program would crash if you clicked when not on one of the
  known points (the bug was always there, but it only came to the surface
  with v 0.99.4)
- fixed bug: program would complete a computer-computer game even if you
  killed the main window
- small improvement: the logwindow will now scroll to the last line 
  automatically
- added an icon to the MS Windows version

 v 0.99.4 beta
----------
- solved problem of moves not being animated correctly after an UNDO.
- added the "Make drawing"-option to the edit-menu
  this lets you save the current board-situation as a gif-file
- internally, the resolution of the clock is now smaller than 1 second
  (in principal, it is now 1 microsecond)
    => can be important for computer-games
- GF1 should now quit correctly on MS windows when you don't use the 
  exit-menuoption. (bug reported by several people)
- checked source for compilation with fltk 1.0

 v 0.99.4.forum beta
----------------
- Only released to a very select group of people!

 v 0.99.3 beta
----------
lots of updates and improvements

- options "Start game" and "Computer move" implemented
- the documentation is reasonably complete now
- the help-window can be kept open now while playing the game.
- included patches for compilation with the Irix compiler
  (thanks to Bill Spitzak)
- The option "Save board" can be used during a game.

 v 0.99.2 beta
----------
The first version that is distributed with source-code and to the world.

The userinterface has been completely rewritten to use FLTK now instead of
V.

 v 0.91b
---------
This is a bug-fix to solve a major problem that made the computer player
very slow.

 v 0.91
--------
This is a new version to solve some bugs and add some changes
suggested by some of the users.

- changed the search-algorithm from 'mtdf' to 
  'minimax with alfa-beta pruning', this makes the searching
  slower but it looks like it plays a little better.
- give possibility to play at level 6
- several bugs that occured when the computer plays at level 1
  have been solved
- position-names are now shown on the screen
- when the computer finds several moves with the same value, he
  will choose one at random. 
- the default when starting a new game is now "tournament"

Several people have asked for an undo-button.
I'm still thinking about it, but I don't think I will implement it.
It feels too much like cheating to me.
If you've done a bad move, you've done a bad move and you have to
play on from there. If you're playing against another player, you
can not take back a move either.
(If somebody has another point of view, please let me know)

This version is still not ver general distribution.
Only people that get the program directly from me should have it.

 v 0.90
--------
First version to be distributed to a select group of people.
The program is not ready for general distribution yet.
