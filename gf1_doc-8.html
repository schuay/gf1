<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.1">8.1 File menu</A>
</H2>

<P>The File menu contains general options for dealing with a game of GIPF.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>New game</B><DD><P>This is the option to use when you want to start a new game. It 
opens a window allowing you to enter all the settings necessary for a 
game of GIPF:
<UL>
<LI>Game type: Here you choose the type of game you want to play. These
options correspond to the 3 game-types explained in the official GIPF-rules.</LI>
<LI>Timed game: Turn this option on if you want to restrict the time each
player has for playing a complete game.</LI>
<LI>Player (white and black): For each colour you can choose what kind
of player will use it. Choose human for one colour and computer for the other
if you want to play against the computer, but both sides human or both
sides computer are also valid settings.</LI>
<LI>Player name (white and black): The names entered here will be shown on
each side of the game-board.</LI>
<LI>Player time (white and black): If you turned on the "Timed game"-option
then you can change the number of minutes allowed for each player.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<DT><B>Load game</B><DD><P>Load a game that you saved earlier. If you saved during a game
then you can resume the game from where you stopped.
<P>
<DT><B>Save game</B><DD><P>Save a game in progress. This allows you to return to the game
later. A window will open where you can enter a filename.
<P>
<DT><B>Save log</B><DD><P>If you just finished a memorable game then you can use this
option to save all your moves to a file. In case you want to see later how
you won (or lost) that game.
<P>
<DT><B>Setup</B><DD><P>Change game settings:
<UL>
<LI>Computer strength: From 1 to 8, level one is for absolute beginners, from
level 4 on the computer plays quite strong. At settings above 5 the computer 
can take a long time calculating his move. </LI>
<LI>Move animation: If you turn the animation on, every move you make will be
shown with moving pieces (This makes it easier to understand what is 
happening). </LI>
<LI>Wait before computer move: To make computer moves easier to understand 
you can make the program wait before executing each computer move. The program
will show what move the computer intends to make and wait the number of
seconds you enter here.</LI>
<LI>Wait before removing a row/gipf: To make it easier to understand what
happens when rows and gipf-pieces are removed from the board, you can set this
to something different then 0. The computer will then show what it intends to 
remove and wait a number of seconds.</LI>
<LI>Show position names: If you set this option then position-names
will be shown on the board when you move over it.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.3">8.3 UNDO</A>
</H2>

<P>When you use UNDO, the game will be returned to the situation before
you made your last move. This allows you to try again if you made a stupid
mistake.
<P>This option from the menubar is only usable under certain conditions:
<UL>
<LI>During a game</LI>
<LI>When you are not playing a timed game. (this would be too much like
cheating)</LI>
</UL>
<P><B>REMARK:</B> You can only do UNDO once at a certain moment in
the game. It is not possible to press UNDO several times to go back more
than 1 move.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.4">8.4 Help menu</A>
</H2>

<P>This menu contains only 2 options.
<P>The HELP-option opens a window containing the complete GF1-manual.
At the top you get a list of all the different chapters in the manual. When
you click on one of the lines, the helptext will immediatly jump to the
correct chapter. The help-window can be left open while playing.
<P>The ABOUT-option just opens a window showing the version of GF1 you are
using and the author. Press enter or click on the window to remove it.
(This is the same window you see when GF1 starts up. At startup, the window 
goes away automatically after 5 seconds.)
