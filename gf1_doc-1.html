<P>GIPF is a strategic game for two players based on a classic
concept: in turns, players introduce one piece into play until
achieving four-in-a-row. Players then remove their row and capture
any of their opponent's pieces which extend that row. This
principle of capturing pieces creates each time again completely
changed situations on the board. The purpose is to form successive
rows of at least 4 pieces, until the opponent has no piece left to
bring into play.
