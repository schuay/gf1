 how to compile GF1 from source
================================
Since this is the first time I distribute source for one of my programs,
these instructions may be incomplete.
If you have problems, let me know and I will try to help.

what do you need
----------------
+ source for GF1
  you can find the latest version on the GF1-website,
  the name of the file should be something like:
     gf1_src_<version>.zip

+ the fltk-library
  this can be found on the FLTK-website (http://fltk.easysw.com/)
  the latest available version should be OK.

If you want to implement the 'Make drawing'-option:
+ the gd-library
  can be found on the website of Thomas Boutell (http://fltk.boutell.com/gd/)
  the latest available version should be OK.
  (you will also need libpng and zlib)

compiling on Linux
------------------
+ compile and install the fltk-library according to the instructions included
  with FLTK.

+ unzip the gf1 source-archive and type make.

If you want to implement the 'Make drawing'-option:
+ do a normal install of gd, libpng and zlib

If you don't want to implement the 'Make drawing'-option, then you
should check the start of the make-file and put the corresponding line
about the GD-library in comment.

compiling on MS windows
-----------------------
+ compile the fltk-library according to the instructions included with FLTK.

If you want to implement the 'Make drawing'-option:
+ compile the libraries in a subdirectory (same name as the library)

+ I used the mingw32-compiler and gnu make to compile FLTK, If you want to
  use an other compiler, you are on your own.

  You will probably have to change the linker-flags in the makefile to
  get the compilation to succeed.
